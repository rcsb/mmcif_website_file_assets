Data items in the ARRAY_DATA category are the containers for
the array data items described in the category ARRAY_STRUCTURE.

It is recognized that the data in this category need to be used in
two distinct ways.  During a data collection the lack of ancillary
data and timing constraints in processing data may dictate the
need to make a &apos;miniCBF&apos;, nothing more than an essential minimum
of information to record the results of the data collection.  In that
case it is proper to use the ARRAY_DATA category as a
container for just a single image and a compacted, beamline-dependent
list of data collection parameter values.  In such
a case, only the tags &apos;_array_data.header_convention&apos;,
&apos;_array_data.header_contents&apos; and &apos;_array_data.data&apos; need be
populated.

For full processing and archiving, most of the tags in this
dictionary will need to be populated.

        Example 1.

        This example shows two binary data blocks.  The first one
        was compressed by the CBF_CANONICAL compression algorithm and is
        presented as hexadecimal data.  The first character &apos;H&apos; on the
        data lines means hexadecimal.  It could have been &apos;O&apos; for octal
        or &apos;D&apos; for decimal.  The second character on the line shows
        the number of bytes in each word (in this case &apos;4&apos;), which then
        requires eight hexadecimal digits per word.  The third character
        gives the order of octets within a word, in this case &apos;&lt;&apos;
        for the ordering 4321 (i.e. &apos;big-endian&apos;).  Alternatively, the
        character &apos;&gt;&apos; could have been used for the ordering 1234
        (i.e. &apos;little-endian&apos;).  The block has a &apos;message digest&apos;
        to check the integrity of the data.

        The second block is similar, but uses CBF_PACKED compression
        and BASE64 encoding.  Note that the size and the digest are
        different.

        Example 2.

        This example shows a single image in a miniCBF, provided by
        E. Eikenberry.  The entire CBF consists of one data block
        containing one category and three tags.  The CBFlib
        program convert_miniCBF and a suitable template file
        can be used to convert this miniCBF to a full imgCIF
        file.

The value of attribute data in category array_data contains the array data
 encapsulated in a STAR string.

The representation used is a variant on the
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) specified
in RFC 2045-2049 by N. Freed et al.  The boundary
delimiter used in writing an imgCIF or CBF is
\n--CIF-BINARY-FORMAT-SECTION-- (including the
required initial \n--, where \n represents the system
newline character(s)).

The Content-Type may be any of the discrete types permitted
in RFC 2045; &apos;application/octet-stream&apos; is recommended
for diffraction images in the ARRAY_DATA category.
Note:  When appropriate in other categories, e.g. for
photographs of crystals, more precise types, such as
&apos;image/jpeg&apos;, &apos;image/tiff&apos;, &apos;image/png&apos;, etc. should be used.

If an octet stream was compressed, the compression should
be specified by the parameter
conversions=&quot;X-CBF_PACKED&quot;
or the parameter
conversions=&quot;X-CBF_CANONICAL&quot;
or the parameter
conversions=&quot;X-CBF_BYTE_OFFSET&quot;
or the parameter
conversions=&quot;X-CBF_BACKGROUND_OFFSET_DELTA&quot;

If the parameter
conversions=&quot;X-CBF_PACKED&quot;
is given it may be further modified with the parameters
uncorrelated_sections
or
flat
(e.g. conversions=&quot;X-CBF_PACKED flat&quot;).
In such cases the attribute compression_type_flag
 in category array_structure should also be present with the corresponding value.

If the &quot;uncorrelated_sections&quot; parameter is
given, each section will be compressed without using
the prior section for averaging.

If the &quot;flat&quot; parameter is given, each
image will be treated as one long row.

Note that X-CBF_CANONICAL and X-CBF_PACKED are
slower but more efficient compressions than the others.
The X-CBF_BYTE_OFFSET compression is a good compromise
between speed and efficiency for ordinary diffraction
images.  The X-CBF_BACKGROUND_OFFSET_DELTA compression
is oriented towards sparse data, such as masks and
tables of replacement pixel values for images with
overloaded spots.

The Content-Transfer-Encoding may be &apos;BASE64&apos;,
&apos;Quoted-Printable&apos;, &apos;X-BASE8&apos;, &apos;X-BASE10&apos;,
&apos;X-BASE16&apos; or &apos;X-BASE32K&apos;, for an imgCIF or &apos;BINARY&apos;
for a CBF.  The octal, decimal and hexadecimal transfer
encodings are provided for convenience in debugging and
are not recommended for archiving and data interchange.

In a CIF, one of the parameters &apos;charset=us-ascii&apos;,
&apos;charset=utf-8&apos; or &apos;charset=utf-16&apos; may be used on the
Content-Transfer-Encoding to specify the character set
used for the external presentation of the encoded data.
If no charset parameter is given, the character set of
the enclosing CIF is assumed.  In any case, if a BOM
flag is detected (FE FF for big-endian UTF-16, FF FE for
little-endian UTF-16 or EF BB BF for UTF-8) is detected,
the indicated charset will be assumed until the end of the
encoded data or the detection of a different BOM.  The
charset of the Content-Transfer-Encoding is not the character
set of the encoded data, only the character set of the
presentation of the encoded data and should be respecified
for each distinct STAR string.

In an imgCIF file, the encoded binary data begin after
the empty line terminating the header.  In an imgCIF file,
the encoded binary data ends with the terminating boundary
delimiter &apos;\n--CIF-BINARY-FORMAT-SECTION----&apos;
in the currently effective charset or with the &apos;\n;&apos;
that terminates the STAR string.

In a CBF, the raw binary data begin after an empty line
terminating the header and after the sequence:

Octet   Hex   Decimal  Purpose
0     0C       12    Ctrl-L: page break
1     1A       26    Ctrl-Z: stop listings, MS-DOS
2     04       04    Ctrl-D: stop listings, UNIX
3     D5      213    binary section begins

None of these octets are included in the calculation of
the message size or in the calculation of the
message digest.

The X-Binary-Size header specifies the size of the
equivalent binary data in octets.  If compression was
used, this size is the size after compression, including
any book-keeping fields.  An adjustment is made for
the deprecated binary formats in which eight bytes of binary
header are used for the compression type.  In this case,
the eight bytes used for the compression type are subtracted
from the size, so that the same size will be reported
if the compression type is supplied in the MIME header.
Use of the MIME header is the recommended way to
supply the compression type.  In general, no portion of
the  binary header is included in the calculation of the size.

The X-Binary-Element-Type header specifies the type of
binary data in the octets, using the same descriptive
phrases as in attribute encoding_type in category array_structure. The default
 value is &apos;unsigned 32-bit integer&apos;.

An MD5 message digest may, optionally, be used. The &apos;RSA Data
Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm&apos; should be used.
No portion of the header is included in the calculation of the
message digest.

If the Transfer Encoding is &apos;X-BASE8&apos;, &apos;X-BASE10&apos; or
&apos;X-BASE16&apos;, the data are presented as octal, decimal or
hexadecimal data organized into lines or words.  Each word
is created by composing octets of data in fixed groups of
2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 octets, either in the order ...4321 (&apos;big-
endian&apos;) or 1234... (&apos;little-endian&apos;).  If there are fewer
than the specified number of octets to fill the last word,
then the missing octets are presented as &apos;==&apos; for each
missing octet.  Exactly two equal signs are used for each
missing octet even for octal and decimal encoding.
The format of lines is:

rnd xxxxxx xxxxxx xxxxxx

where r is &apos;H&apos;, &apos;O&apos; or &apos;D&apos; for hexadecimal, octal or
decimal, n is the number of octets per word and d is &apos;&lt;&apos;
or &apos;&gt;&apos; for the &apos;...4321&apos; and &apos;1234...&apos; octet orderings,
respectively.  The &apos;==&apos; padding for the last word should
be on the appropriate side to correspond to the missing
octets, e.g.

H4&lt; FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF 07FFFFFF ====0000

or

H3&gt; FF0700 00====

For these hexadecimal, octal and decimal formats only,
comments beginning with &apos;#&apos; are permitted to improve
readability.

BASE64 encoding follows MIME conventions.  Octets are
in groups of three: c1, c2, c3.  The resulting 24 bits
are broken into four six-bit quantities, starting with
the high-order six bits (c1 &gt;&gt; 2) of the first octet, then
the low-order two bits of the first octet followed by the
high-order four bits of the second octet [(c1 &amp; 3)&lt;&lt;4 | (c2&gt;&gt;4)],
then the bottom four bits of the second octet followed by the
high-order two bits of the last octet [(c2 &amp; 15)&lt;&lt;2 | (c3&gt;&gt;6)],
then the bottom six bits of the last octet (c3 &amp; 63).  Each
of these four quantities is translated into an ASCII character
using the mapping:

1         2         3         4         5         6
0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123
|         |         |         |         |         |         |
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/

with short groups of octets padded on the right with one &apos;=&apos;
if c3 is missing, and with &apos;==&apos; if both c2 and c3 are missing.

X-BASE32K encoding is similar to BASE64 encoding, except that
sets of 15 octets are encoded as sets of 8 16-bit Unicode
characters, by breaking the 120 bits into 8 15-bit quantities.
256 is added to each 15-bit quantity to bring it into a
printable Unicode range.  When encoding, zero padding is used
to fill out the last 15-bit quantity.  If 8 or more bits of
padding are used, a single equals sign (hexadecimal 003D) is
appended.  Embedded whitespace and newlines are introduced
to produce lines of no more than 80 characters each.  On
decoding, all printable ASCII characters and ASCII whitespace
characters are ignored except for any trailing equals signs.
The number of trailing equals signs indicated the number of
trailing octets to be trimmed from the end of the decoded data
(see Darakev et al., 2006).

QUOTED-PRINTABLE encoding also follows MIME conventions, copying
octets without translation if their ASCII values are 32...38,
42, 48...57, 59, 60, 62, 64...126 and the octet is not a &apos;;&apos;
in column 1.  All other characters are translated to =nn, where
nn is the hexadecimal encoding of the octet.  All lines are
&apos;wrapped&apos; with a terminating &apos;=&apos; (i.e. the MIME conventions
for an implicit line terminator are never used).

The &apos;X-Binary-Element-Byte-Order&apos; can specify either
&apos;BIG_ENDIAN&apos; or &apos;LITTLE_ENDIAN&apos; byte order of the image
data.  Only LITTLE_ENDIAN is recommended.  Processors
may treat BIG_ENDIAN as a warning of data that can
only be processed by special software.

The &apos;X-Binary-Number-of-Elements&apos; specifies the number of
elements (not the number of octets) in the decompressed,
decoded image.

The optional &apos;X-Binary-Size-Fastest-Dimension&apos; specifies the
number of elements (not the number of octets) in one row of the
fastest changing dimension of the binary data array. This
information must be in the MIME header for proper operation of
some of the decompression algorithms.

The optional &apos;X-Binary-Size-Second-Dimension&apos; specifies the
number of elements (not the number of octets) in one column of
the second-fastest changing dimension of the binary data array.
This information must be in the MIME header for proper operation
of some of the decompression algorithms.

The optional &apos;X-Binary-Size-Third-Dimension&apos; specifies the
number of sections for the third-fastest changing dimension of
the binary data array.

The optional &apos;X-Binary-Size-Padding&apos; specifies the size in
octets of an optional padding after the binary array data and
before the closing flags for a binary section.

incident photons.  In most cases, the number stored
in the final array will have a simple linear relationship
to the actual number of incident photons, given by
attribute gain in category array_intensities. If raw, uncorrected values
 are presented (e.g. for calibration experiments), the
value of attribute linearity in category array_intensities will be &apos;raw&apos;
 and attribute gain in category array_intensities will not be used. 

        Example 1
&lt;mmcif_img:array_intensitiesCategory&gt;
   &lt;mmcif_img:array_intensities array_id=&quot;image_1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;mmcif_img:gain&gt;1.2&lt;/mmcif_img:gain&gt;

The intensity linearity scaling method used to convert
from the raw intensity to the stored element value:

&apos;linear&apos; is linear.

&apos;offset&apos;  means that the value defined by
attribute offset in category array_intensities should be added to each
 element value.

&apos;scaling&apos; means that the value defined by
attribute scaling in category array_intensities should be multiplied with each
 element value.

&apos;scaling_offset&apos; is the combination of the two previous cases,
with the scale factor applied before the offset value.

&apos;sqrt_scaled&apos; means that the square root of raw
intensities multiplied by attribute scaling in category array_intensities is
 calculated and stored, perhaps rounded to the nearest
integer. Thus, linearization involves dividing the stored
values by attribute scaling in category array_intensities and squaring the
 result.

&apos;logarithmic_scaled&apos; means that the logarithm base 10 of
raw intensities multiplied by attribute scaling
 in category array_intensities is calculated and stored, perhaps rounded to the nearest
integer. Thus, linearization involves dividing the stored
values by attribute scaling in category array_intensities and calculating 10
 to the power of this number.

&apos;raw&apos; means that the data are a set of raw values straight
from the detector.

Data encoding of a single element of array data.

The type &apos;unsigned 1-bit integer&apos; is used for
packed Boolean arrays for masks.  Each element
of the array corresponds to a single bit
packed in unsigned 8-bit data.

In several cases, the IEEE format is referenced.

Data items in the ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST_AXIS category describe
the physical settings of sets of axes for the centres of pixels that
correspond to data points described in the
ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST category.

In the simplest cases, the physical increments of a single axis correspond
to the increments of a single array index.  More complex organizations,
e.g. spiral scans, may require coupled motions along multiple axes.

Note that a spiral scan uses two coupled axes: one for the angular
direction and one for the radial direction.  This differs from a
cylindrical scan for which the two axes are not coupled into one
set.

Axes may be specified either for an entire array or for just a section
of an array.

Data items in the ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST_SECTION category identify
the dimension-by-dimension start, end and stride of each section of an
array that is to be referenced.

For any array with identifier ARRAYID, array section ids of the form
ARRAYID(start1:end1:stride1,start2:end2:stride2, ...) are defined
by default.

For the given index, the elements in the section are of indices:
attribute start,
 in category array_structure_list_section _array_structure_list_section.start + _array_structure_list_section.stride,
attribute start in category array_structure_list_section + 2*_array_structure_list_section.stride,

of that dimension or
[min(_array_structure_list_section.start, attribute end),
 in category array_structure_list_section max(_array_structure_list_section.start, attribute end)].
 in category array_structure_list_section 

The ordering of these elements is determined by the overall ordering of
attribute array_id in category array_structure_list_section and not by the ordering implied
 by the stride.

                    the slow index high is 700, the last frame that
                    will actually be included is only 691.

Data items in the AXIS category record the information required
to describe the various goniometer, detector, source and other
axes needed to specify a data collection or the axes defining the
coordinate system of an image.

The location of each axis is specified by two vectors: the axis
itself, given by a unit vector in the direction of the axis, and
an offset to the base of the unit vector.

The vectors defining an axis are referenced to an appropriate
coordinate system, given in attribute system in category axis. The axis vector itself,
 [_axis.vector[1], _axis.vector[2], _axis.vector[3]],
is a dimensionless unit vector.  Where meaningful, an offset vector
[_axis.offset[1], _axis.offset[2], _axis.offset[3]]
supplies the offsets to the base of a rotation or translation axis in
X, Y and Z.  This is appropriate for the imgCIF standard laboratory
coordinate system, the NeXus/HDF5 McStas laboratory coordinate system
and the last two Cartesian coordinate systems, but for the direct lattice,
X corresponds to a, Y to b and Z to c, while for the reciprocal lattice,
X corresponds to a*, Y to b* and Z to c*.

For purposes of visualization, all the coordinate systems are
taken as right-handed, i.e. using the convention that the extended
thumb of a right hand could point along the first (X) axis, the
straightened pointer finger could point along the second (Y) axis
and the middle finger folded inward could point along the third (Z)
axis.  For a right-handed rotation axis, if the right hand is wrapped
around the axis with the thumb pointed in the direction of the axis,
the fingers point in the positive rotation direction, i.e. clockwise.

THE IMGCIF STANDARD LABORATORY COORDINATE SYSTEM


The imgCIF standard laboratory coordinate system is a right-handed
orthogonal coordinate system similar to that used by MOSFLM,
but imgCIF puts Z along the X-ray beam, rather than putting X along the
X-ray beam as in MOSFLM.

The vectors for the imgCIF standard laboratory coordinate system
form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with its origin
in the sample or specimen.  The origin of the axis system should,
if possible, be defined in terms of mechanically stable axes to be
both in the sample and in the beam.  If the sample goniometer or other
sample positioner has two axes the intersection of which defines a
unique point at which the sample should be mounted to be bathed
by the beam, that will be the origin of the axis system.  If no such
point is defined, then the midpoint of the line of intersection
between the sample and the centre of the beam will define the origin.
For this definition the sample positioning system will be set at
its initial reference position for the experiment.

Axis 1 (X): The X-axis is aligned to the mechanical axis pointing from
the sample or specimen along the  principal axis of the goniometer or
sample positioning system if the sample positioning system has an axis
that intersects the origin and which forms an angle of more than 22.5
degrees with the beam axis.

Axis 2 (Y): The Y-axis completes an orthogonal right-handed system
defined by the X-axis and the Z-axis (see below).

Axis 3 (Z): The Z-axis is derived from the source axis which goes from
the sample to the source.  The Z-axis is the component of the source axis
in the direction of the source orthogonal to the X-axis in the plane
defined by the X-axis and the source axis.

If the conditions for the X-axis can be met, the coordinate system
will be based on the goniometer or other sample positioning system
and the beam and not on the orientation of the detector, gravity etc.
The vectors necessary to specify all other axes are given by sets of
three components in the order (X, Y, Z).
If the axis involved is a rotation axis, it is right-handed, i.e. as
one views the object to be rotated from the origin (the tail) of the
unit vector, the rotation is clockwise.  If a translation axis is
specified, the direction of the unit vector specifies the sense of
positive translation.

In some experimental techniques, there is no goniometer or the principal
axis of the goniometer is at a small acute angle with respect to
the source axis.  In such cases, other reference axes are needed
to define a useful coordinate system.  The order of priority in
defining directions in such cases is to use the detector, then
gravity, then north.

If the X-axis cannot be defined as above, then the
direction (not the origin) of the X-axis should be parallel to the axis
of the primary detector element corresponding to the most rapidly
varying dimension of that detector element&apos;s data array, with its
positive sense corresponding to increasing values of the index for
that dimension.  If the detector is such that such a direction cannot
be defined (as with a point detector) or that the direction forms an
angle of less than 22.5 degrees with respect to the source axis, then
the X-axis should be chosen so that if the Y-axis is chosen
in the direction of gravity, and the Z-axis is chosen to be along
the source axis, a right-handed orthogonal coordinate system is chosen.
In the case of a vertical source axis, as a last resort, the
X-axis should be chosen to point north.

All rotations are given in degrees and all translations are given in mm.

Axes may be dependent on one another.  The X-axis is the only goniometer
axis the direction of which is strictly connected to the hardware.  All
other axes are specified by the positions they would assume when the
axes upon which they depend are at their zero points.

When specifying detector axes, the axis is given to the beam centre.
The location of the beam centre on the detector should be given in the
DIFFRN_DETECTOR category in distortion-corrected millimetres from
the (0,0) corner of the detector.

For convenience when describing detector element (module) placement,
an optional mounting rotation axis and rotation angle may be
specified.  In such cases, the mounting rotation axis and angle
of rotation around the mounting rotation axis are applied after
applying the transformations upon which the given axis depends.

It should be noted that many different origins arise in the definition
of an experiment.  In particular, as noted above, it is necessary to
specify the location of the beam centre on the detector in terms
of the origin of the detector, which is, of course, not coincident
with the centre of the sample.

THE NEXUS/HDF5 MCSTAS LABORATORY COORDINATE SYSTEM


The standard coordinate frame in NeXus is the McStas coordinate frame,
in which the Z-axis points in the direction of the incident beam, the
X-axis is orthogonal to the Z-axis in the horizontal plane and pointing
left as seen from the source and the Y-axis points upwards.  The
origin is in the sample.

Differences in Coordinate Frames

The standard coordinate frame in imgCIF/CBF aligns the X-axis to the
principal goniometer axis, and chooses the Z-axis to point from the sample
into the beam.  If the beam is not orthogonal to the X-axis, the Z-axis
is the component of the vector that points into the beam orthogonal to the
X-axis.  The Y-axis is chosen to complete a right-handed axis system.

Let us call the NeXus coordinate axes, X_nx, Y_nx and Z_nx, the
imgCIF/CBF coordinate axes, X_cbf, Y_cbf and Z_cbf and the direction
of gravity, Gravity.  In order to translate a vector v_nx = ( x, y, z)
from the NeXus coordinate system to the imgCIF coordinate system, we
also need two additional axes, as unit vectors, Gravity_cbf the downwards
direction, and  Beam_cbf, the direction of the beam, e.g. ( 0, 0, -1).

In practice, the beam is not necessarily perfectly horizontal, so Y_nx
is not necessarily perfectly vertical. Therefore, in order to generate
X_nx, Y_nx and Z_nx some care is needed.  The cross product between two
vectors a and b is a new vector c orthogonal to both a and b,
chosen so that a, b, c is a right-handed system.  If a and b are
orthogonal unit vectors, this right-handed system is an orthonormal
coordinate system.

In the CBF coordinate frame, Z_nx is aligned to Beam_cbf:

Z_nx = Beam_cbf.

X_nx is defined as being horizontal at right angles to the beam,
pointing to the left when seen from the source.  Assuming the beam is
not vertical, we can compute X_nx as the normalized cross product of
the  beam and gravity:

X_nx = (Beam_cbf x Gravity_cbf)/||Beam_cbf x Gravity_cbf||.

To see that this satisfies the constraint of being horizontal and
pointing to the left, consider the case of Beam = ( 0, 0, -1 )
and Gravity = ( 0, 0, 1 ); then we would have X_nx = ( 1, 0, 0 )
from the cross product above.  The normalization is only necessary
if the beam is not horizontal.

Finally Y_nx is computed as the cross product of the beam and X_nx,
completing an orthonormal right-handed system with Y_nx pointing upwards

Y_nx = Beam_cbf x X_nx.

Then we know that in the imgCIF/CBF coordinate frame

v_nx = X.X_nx + Y.Y_nx + Z.Z_nx.

Thus, given the imgCIF/CBF vectors for the true direction of the beam
and the true direction of gravity, we have a linear transformation from
the NeXus coordinate frame to the imgCIF/CBF coordinate frame.   The
origins of the two frames agree.   The inverse linear transformation will
transform a vector in the imgCIF/CBF coordinate frame into the NeXus
coordinate frame.

In the common case in which the beam is orthogonal to the principal
goniometer axis so that Beam_cbf = ( 0, 0, -1 ) and the imgCIF/CBF
Y-axis points upwards, the transformation inverts the X and Z axes.
In the other common case in which the beam is orthogonal to the
principal goniometer axis and the imgCIF/CBF Y-axis points
downwards, the transformation inverts the Y and Z axes.

Mapping axes

There are two transformations needed:  coord_xform(v) which takes a vector,
v, in the CBF imgCIF Standard Laboratory Coordinate System and returns the
equivalent McStas coordinate vector, and offset_xform(o) which takes an
offset, o, in the CBF imgCIF Standard Laboratory Coordinate System and
returns the equivalent NeXus offset.

In imgCIF/CBF all the information about all axes other than their
settings are gathered in one AXIS category.  The closest equivalent
container in NeXus is the NXinstrument class.  We put the information
about detector axes into a
detector:NXdetector/transformations:NXtransformations NeXus class instance,
information about the goniometer into a
goniometer:NXgoniometer/transformations:NXtransformations NeXus
class instance, etc.  Additionally, in view of the general nature of
some axes, such as the coordinate frame axes and gravity, we add a
transformations:NXtransformation NeXus class instance under NXentry with
axis__gravity, axis__beam and other axes not tied to specific equipment.

We have applied the coordinate frame transformation changing
the CBF laboratory coordinates into McStas coordinates.  Notice that X and
Z have changed direction, but Y has not.   In other experimental setups,
other transformations may occur.   The offsets for dependent axes are
given relative to the total offset of axes on which that axis is dependent.
Note that the axis settings do not enter into this calculation, because the
offsets of dependent axes are given with all axes at their zero settings.


The cbf_location attribute gives a mapping back into the CBF AXIS category
in dotted notation.  The first component is the data block.  The second
component is &quot;axis&quot;.  The third component is either &quot;vector&quot; or
&quot;offset&quot;  for information drawn from the AXIS.VECTOR[...] or
AXIS.OFFSET[...] respectively.  The last component is the CBF row number
to facilitate recovering the original CBF layout.


THE DIRECT LATTICE (FRACTIONAL COORDINATES)


The unit cell, reciprocal cell and crystallographic orthogonal
Cartesian coordinate system are defined by the CELL and the matrices
in the ATOM_SITES category.

The direct lattice coordinate system is a system of fractional
coordinates aligned to the crystal, rather than to the laboratory.
This is a natural coordinate system for maps and atomic coordinates.
It is the simplest coordinate system in which to apply symmetry.
The axes are determined by the cell edges, and are not necessarily
orthogonal.  This coordinate system is not uniquely defined and
depends on the cell parameters in the CELL category and the
settings chosen to index the crystal.

Molecules in a crystal studied by X-ray diffraction are organized
into a repeating regular array of unit cells.  Each unit cell is defined
by three vectors, a, b and c.  To quote from Drenth (2001),


&quot;The choice of the unit cell is not unique and therefore, guidelines
have been established for selecting the standard basis vectors and
the origin.  They are based on symmetry and metric considerations:

&quot;(1)  The axial system should be right-handed.
(2)  The basis vectors should coincide as much as possible with
directions of highest symmetry.
(3)  The cell taken should be the smallest one that satisfies
condition (2)
(4)  Of all the lattice vectors, none is shorter than a.
(5)  Of those not directed along a, none is shorter than b.
(6)  Of those not lying in the ab plane, none is shorter than c.
(7)  The three angles between the basis vectors a, b and c are
either all acute (&lt;90 degrees) or all obtuse (≥90 degrees).&quot;

These rules do not produce a unique result that is stable under
the assumption of experimental errors, and the resulting cell
may not be primitive.

In this coordinate system, the vector (.5, .5, .5) is in the middle
of the given unit cell.

Grid coordinates are an important variation on fractional coordinates
used when working with maps.  In imgCIF, the conversion from
fractional to grid coordinates is implicit in the array indexing
specified by attribute dimension in category array_structure_list. Note that this
 implicit grid-coordinate scheme is 1-based, not zero-based, i.e.
the origin of the cell for axes along the cell edges with no
specified attribute displacement in category array_structure_list_axis will have
 grid coordinates of (1,1,1), i.e. array indices of (1,1,1).

THE ORTHOGONAL CARTESIAN COORDINATE SYSTEM (REAL SPACE)


The orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system is a transformation of
the direct lattice to the actual physical coordinates of atoms in
space.  It is similar to the laboratory coordinate system, but
is anchored to and moves with the crystal, rather than being
anchored to the laboratory.  The transformation from fractional
to orthogonal Cartesian coordinates is given by the
attribute Cartn_transf_matrix[i][j] in category atom_sites and
 attribute Cartn_transf_vector[i]
 in category atom_sites tags.  A common choice for the matrix of the transformation is
given in Protein Data Bank (1992):

| a      b cos \g   c cos \b                            |
| 0      b sin \g   c (cos \a - cos \b cos \g)/sin \g   |
| 0      0          V/(a b sin \g)                      |

This is a convenient coordinate system in which to do fitting
of models to maps and in which to understand the chemistry of
a molecule.

THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE


The reciprocal lattice coordinate system is used for diffraction
intensities.  It is based on the reciprocal cell, the dual of the cell,
in which reciprocal cell edges are derived from direct cell faces:

a* = bc sin \a /V  b* = ac sin \b /V  c* = ab sin \g /V
cos \a* = (cos \b  cos \g  - cos \a )/(sin \b sin \g )
cos \b* = (cos \a  cos \g  - cos \b )/(sin \a sin \g )
cos \g* = (cos \a  cos \b  - cos \g )/(sin \a sin \b )
V = abc (1 - cos^2^ \a
- cos^2^ \b
- cos^2^ \g
+ 2 cos \a cos \b cos \g )^1/2^

In this form the dimensions of the reciprocal lattice are in reciprocal
\&#37;angstr\&quot;oms (\&#37;A^-1^).  A dimensionless form can be obtained by
multiplying by the wavelength.  Reflections are commonly indexed against
this coordinate system as (h, k, l) triples.

      Example 1.

        This example shows the axis specification of the axes of a
        kappa-geometry goniometer [see Stout, G. H. &amp; Jensen, L. H.
        (1989). X-ray structure determination. A practical
        guide, 2nd ed. p. 134. New York: Wiley Interscience].

        There are three axes specified, and no offsets.  The outermost axis,
        omega, is pointed along the X axis.  The next innermost axis, kappa,
        is at a 50 degree angle to the X axis, pointed away from the source.
        The innermost axis, phi, aligns with the X axis when omega and
        phi are at their zero points.  If T-omega, T-kappa and T-phi
        are the transformation matrices derived from the axis settings,
        the complete transformation would be:
            X&apos; = (T-omega) (T-kappa) (T-phi) X

        reminder that the ordering of presentation of tokens is not
        significant.  The centre of rotation of the detector has been taken
        to be 68 mm in the direction away from the source.

        This example shows the axis specification of the axes for a map,
        using fractional coordinates.  Each cell edge has been divided
        into a grid of 50 divisions in the ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST_AXIS
        category.  The map is using only the first octant of the grid
        in the ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST category.

        The fastest changing axis is along A, then along B,
        and the slowest is along C.

        The map sampling is being done in the middle of each grid
        division.

      Example 4.

        This example shows the axis specification of the axes for a map,
        this time as orthogonal \&#37;angstr\&quot;oms, using the same coordinate system
        as for the atomic coordinates.  The map is sampling every 1.5
        \&#37;A (1.5e-7 mm) in a map segment 37.5 \&#37;A on a side.

       Example 5.

    This example shows an excerpt from the axis specification of an FEL detector
    provided by N. Sauter and A. Brewster.

    The detector is divided into 4 quadrants, each quadrant contains 8 sensors
    and each sensor contains 2 ASICs.  We want to be able to refine the
    placement of each of these elements, so we maintain the set of vectors
    that places them.

       Example 6.

    This example shows an excerpt from the axis specification of an FEL detector
    provided by N. Sauter and A. Brewster, using _axis.rotation_axis and
    _axis.rotation to organize the positional dependencies.  The approach
    in Example 5 is now preferred.

    The detector is divided into 4 quadrants, each quadrant contains 8 sensors
    and each sensor contains 2 ASICs.  We want to be able to refine the
    placement of each of these elements, so we maintain the set of vectors
    that places them.

    To do this, the first vector of importance is an initial placement axis
    that moves from the origin along the Z axis a distance equal to the
    detector distance.  This is the origin for the rest of the axes and is
    called AXIS_D0_ORIGIN.

    Each subsequent movement involves a frame shift.  This is done by using
    two imgCIF axes: a rotation axis and a translation axis.  The rotation
    axis is listed first, and includes no offset or angle.  The actual frame
    shift is done by using a translation axis.  An offset is used first in
    the parent&apos;s frame, and then an angle is listed to rotate around the
    rotation axis.

    Example, sensor five of quadrant 2.  First a rotation axis is listed:

    AXIS_D0Q2S5_ROT rotation detector AXIS_D0Q2 0.0 0.0 1.0 0 0 0 . .
    This defines a rotation axis around the z axis in the frame of quadrant 2.

    Next a translation axis is listed:
    AXIS_D0Q2S5 translation detector
        AXIS_D0Q2 . . . 34.5494875 -24.1901 0.0 89.68154 AXIS_D0Q2S5_ROT
    Here, in the frame of quadrant 2, we shift X by 34 and Y by -24 mm,
    then rotate 89 degrees around the axis named AXIS_D0Q2S5_ROT.

    And so forth.

Data items in the DIFFRN_DETECTOR_ELEMENT category record
the details about spatial layout and other characteristics
of each element of a detector which may have multiple elements.

In most cases, giving more detailed information
in ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST and ARRAY_STRUCTURE_LIST_AXIS
is preferable to simply providing the centre of the
detector element.
      Example 1. Detector d1 is composed of four CCD detector elements,
        each 200 mm by 200 mm, arranged in a square, in the pattern

                   1     2
                      *
                   3     4

        Note that the beam centre is slightly displaced from each of the
        detector elements, just beyond the lower right corner of 1,
        the lower left corner of 2, the upper right corner of 3 and
        the upper left corner of 4.  For each element, the detector
        face coordinate system is assumed to have the fast axis
        running from left to right and the slow axis running from
        top to bottom with the origin at the top left corner.

This is the first of the Stokes polarization parameters,

Note that, if the polarized intensity Ip+In is required,
(Ip+In)^2^ is the sum of Q^2^+U^2^+V^2^.

The angle in degrees, as viewed from the specimen, between

Y-axis as defined in the AXIS category.

Note that this is the angle of polarization of the source
photons, either directly from a synchrotron beamline or
from a monochromator.

This differs from the value of
attribute polarisn_norm
 in category diffrn_radiation in that attribute polarisn_norm in category diffrn_radiation refers to
 polarization relative to the diffraction plane rather than
to the laboratory axis system.

In the case of an unpolarized beam, or a beam with true
circular polarization, in which no single plane of
polarization can be determined, the plane should be taken
as the XZ plane and the angle as 0.

The quantity (Ip-In)/(Ip+In), where Ip is the intensity
(amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the plane of
polarization and In is the intensity (amplitude squared)
of the electric vector in the plane of the normal to the
plane of polarization.

In the case of an unpolarized beam, or a beam with true
circular polarization, in which no single plane of
polarization can be determined, the plane is to be taken
as the XZ plane and the normal is parallel to the Y axis.

Thus, if there was complete polarization in the plane of
polarization, the value of
attribute polarizn_source_ratio in category diffrn_radiation would be 1, and
 for an unpolarized beam
attribute polarizn_source_ratio in category diffrn_radiation would have a
 value of 0.

If the X axis has been chosen to lie in the plane of
polarization, this definition will agree with the definition
of &apos;MONOCHROMATOR&apos; in the Denzo glossary, and values of near
1 should be expected for a bending-magnet source.  However,
if the X-axis were perpendicular to the polarization plane
(not a common choice), then the Denzo value would be the
negative of attribute polarizn_source_ratio.
 in category diffrn_radiation 
See http://www.hkl-xray.com for information on Denzo and
Otwinowski &amp; Minor (1997).

This differs both in the choice of ratio and choice of
orientation from attribute polarisn_ratio in category diffrn_radiation, which,
 unlike attribute polarizn_source_ratio in category diffrn_radiation, is
 unbounded.

   The vector of each axis is not given here, because it is provided in
   the AXIS category.  By making _diffrn_scan_axis.scan_id and
   _diffrn_scan_axis.axis_id keys of the DIFFRN_SCAN_AXIS category,
   an arbitrary number of scanning and fixed axes can be specified for a
   scan.  In this example, three rotation axes and one translation axis
   at nonzero values are specified, with one axis stepping.  There is no
   reason why more axes could not have been specified to step. Range
   information has been specified, but note that it can be calculated from
   the  number of frames and the increment, so the data item
   _diffrn_scan_axis.angle_range could be dropped.

   Both the sweep data and the data for a single frame are specified.

   Note that the information on how the axes are stepped is given twice,
   once in terms of the overall averages in the value of
   _diffrn_scan.integration_time and the values for DIFFRN_SCAN_AXIS,
   and precisely for the given frame in the value for
   _diffrn_scan_frame.integration_time and the values for
   DIFFRN_SCAN_FRAME_AXIS.  If dose-related adjustments are made to
   scan times and nonlinear stepping is done, these values may differ.
   Therefore, in interpreting the data for a particular frame it is
   important to use the frame-specific data.

   There are three date/times in this set: *.date_start and
   *. date_end_estimated, both of which are mandatory, because the former
   is data which can be logged at the start of collection and the latter
   is data that can be estimated at the same time, and *.date_end which
   can only be logged exactly if the data collection completes normally.

  Example 2. a more extensive example (R. M. Sweet, P. J. Ellis &amp;
   H. J. Bernstein).

   A detector is placed 240 mm along the Z axis from the goniometer.
   This leads to a choice:  either the axes of
   the detector are defined at the origin, and then a Z setting of -240
   is entered, or the axes are defined with the necessary Z offset.
   In this case, the setting is used and the offset is left as zero.
   This axis is called DETECTOR_Z.

   The axis for positioning the detector in the Y direction depends
   on the detector Z axis.  This axis is called DETECTOR_Y.

   The axis for positioning the detector in the X direction depends
   on the detector Y axis (and therefore on the detector Z axis).
   This axis is called DETECTOR_X.

   This detector may be rotated around the Y axis.  This rotation axis
   depends on the three translation axes.  It is called DETECTOR_PITCH.

   A coordinate system is defined on the face of the detector in terms of
   2300 0.150 mm pixels in each direction.  The ELEMENT_X axis is used to
   index the first array index of the data array and the ELEMENT_Y
   axis is used to index the second array index.  Because the pixels
   are 0.150mm x 0.150mm, the centre of the first pixel is at (0.075,
   0.075) in this coordinate system.

   Example 3. Example 2 revised for a spiral scan (R. M. Sweet,
    P. J. Ellis &amp; H. J. Bernstein).

   A detector is placed 240 mm along the Z axis from the
   goniometer, as in Example 2 above, but in this example the
   image plate is scanned in a spiral pattern from the outside edge in.

   The axis for positioning the detector in the Y direction depends
   on the detector Z axis.  This axis is called DETECTOR_Y.

   The axis for positioning the detector in the X direction depends
   on the detector Y axis (and therefore on the detector Z axis).
   This axis is called DETECTOR_X.

   This detector may be rotated around the Y axis.  This rotation axis
   depends on the three translation axes.  It is called DETECTOR_PITCH.

   A coordinate system is defined on the face of the detector in
   terms of a coupled rotation axis and radial scan axis to form
   a spiral scan.  The rotation axis is called  ELEMENT_ROT  and the
   radial axis is called ELEMENT_RAD.  A 150 micrometre radial pitch
   and a 75 micrometre &apos;constant velocity&apos; angular pitch are assumed.

   Indexing is carried out first on the rotation axis and the radial axis
   is made to be dependent on it.

   The two axes are coupled to form an axis set ELEMENT_SPIRAL.

The quantity2*sqrt(IpIn), with a + sign for right-handed
circular polarization, where Ip is the intensity
(amplitude squared) of the electric vector in the plane of
polarization and In is the intensity (amplitude squared) of
the electric vector in the plane of the normal to the
plane of polarization, and theta is the angle as viewed
from the specimen, between the normal to the polarization
plane and the laboratory Y axis as defined in the
AXIS category.

This is an average or other representative sample of the
frame.

This is the fourth of the Stokes polarization parameters,
I, Q, U, V [also known as I, M, C, S; see Berry et al. (1977)].

If the absolute intensity is not known, the value 1.0
is assumed for I, and all four Stokes parameters are
dimensionless.  When the absolute intensity is known,
all four Stokes parameters are in units of watts per
square metre.

Each monitor value is uniquely identified by the combination of
the scan id given by attribute scan_id,
 in category diffrn_scan_frame the frame id given by attribute frame_id,
 in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor the monitor&apos;s detector id given by
attribute detector_id,
 in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor and a 1-based ordinal given by attribute id.
 in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor 
If there is only one frame for the scan, the value of
attribute frame_id in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor may be omitted.
 
A single frame may have more than one monitor value, and each
monitor value may be the result of integration over the entire
frame integration time given by the value of
attribute integration_time,
 in category diffrn_scan_frame or many monitor values may be reported over shorter times given
by the value of attribute integration_time in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor. If
 only one monitor value for a given monitor is collected during
the integration time of the frame, the value of
attribute id in category diffrn_scan_frame_monitor may be
 omitted.
   Example 1. The beam intensity for frame FRAME1 is being tracked
    by a beamstop monitor detector BSM01, made from metal foil and
    a PIN diode, located 20 mm in front of a MAR345 detector and being
    sampled every 2 seconds in a 20 second scan.

The value of attribute mask_array_id in category map_segment, if given, describes
 the array structure into which the mask for the map is
organized.  If no value is given, then all elements of

given as a data type with more range.  However, the two
array structures must be aligned, using the same axes in
the same order with the same displacements and

Data items in the VARIANT category record
the details about sets of variants of data items.

There is sometimes a need to allow for multiple versions of the
same data items in order to allow for refinements and corrections
to earlier assumptions, observations and calculations.  In order
to allow data sets to contain more than one variant of the same
information, an optional *.variant data item as a pointer to
attribute variant in category variant has been added to the key of every category,
 as an implicit data item with a null (empty) default value.

All rows in a category with the same variant value are considered
to be related to one another and to all rows in other categories
with the same variant value.  For a given variant, all such rows
are also considered to be related to all rows with a null variant
value, except that a row with a null variant value for which all
other components of its key are identical to those entries in
another row with a non-null variant value is not related the
the rows with that non-null variant value.  This behaviour is
similar to the convention for identifying alternate conformers
in an atom list.

An optional role may be specified for a variant as the value of
attribute role in category variant. Possible roles are null, &apos;preferred&apos;,
 &apos;raw data&apos;, &apos;unsuccessful trial&apos;.

variants may carry an optional timestamp as the value of
attribute timestamp.
 in category variant 
variants may be related to other variants from which they were
derived by the value of attribute variant_of.

Further details about the variant may be specified as the value
of attribute details.

In order to allow variant information from multiple datasets to
be combined, _variant.diffrn_id and/or _variant.entry_id may
be used.
   Example 1. Distinguishing between a raw beam centre and a refined beam
       centre inferred after indexing.  Detector d1 is composed of
       four CCD detector elements, each 200 mm by 200 mm, arranged
       in a square, in the pattern

                   1     2
                      *
                   3     4

       Note that the beam centre is slightly displaced from each of the
       detector elements, just beyond the lower right corner of 1,
       the lower left corner of 2, the upper right corner of 3 and
       the upper left corner of 4.  For each element, the detector
       face coordinate system is assumed to have the fast axis
       running from left to right and the slow axis running from
       top to bottom with the origin at the top left corner.

       After indexing and refinement, the centre is shifted by 0.2 mm
       left and 0.1 mm down.
